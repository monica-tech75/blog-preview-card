## My process
I start placing the card in the center using grid in the body. I don't know if is the correct way to do it, but it work.
I also create variables for the colors. Then I put the images.(It's my cat, moony).
I also start trying not to use pixels so much.
Recently I learn about vh and vw and is amazing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

It's my first time I use variables in CSS and also Grid, normaly I use flexbox but sometimes is complicated with flexbox.
```css

:root {
  --yellow: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --grey: hsl(0, 0%, 50%);
  --black: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
body {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
```


### Continued development

I gonna start to learn about grid, I think It can be easy to understand or less complicated than flexbox.
